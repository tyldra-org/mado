## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scaffold: Rust workspace with one crate per area, Svelte UI and page script packages, checks and CI.
- The app starts: one process per profile with a profile lock, a second launch hands over to the first, and Cmd-Q or SIGTERM quits cleanly.
- Settings: every setting of the design, stored per app or profile, with protection, undo, search, export and import, and a settings window.
- Storage: SQLite databases that refuse a newer schema, back up before migrating and restore from a backup when damaged.
- Nightly builds for macOS, signed with Mado's own certificate, that update themselves on the nightly channel.
